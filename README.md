ComproPago-magento
==============

Installation
-----------

  * Copy the folder and paste it in the folder where you have installed Magento.
  * In the Magento admin, navigate to 'System-Cache Management'. Select and disable all Cache Types.  Additionally, click "Flush Magento Cache" and "Flush Cache Storage".  These steps will allow you to start testing the plugin.
  * In the 'System->Configuration' section, click the 'Payment Methods' link in the left hand navigation.  Check that the payment methods "Pago con Tarjeta de Débito / Crédito", "Pago con Oxxo" and "Pago con Transferencia Bancaria" appear. If these payment methods do not show up, check that your magento user has priviledges to access the Magento folder.
  * Each of the payment methods should should 'Enabled'=>'Yes', in the 'Api Keys' section for the payment methods paste the api keys found in https://admin.conekta.io#developers.keys, e.g.
    
Api Public Key: 
    `EpnQNGMghzDrytvfpqtG`
Api Private Key: 
    `1tv5yJp3xnVZ7eK67m4h`


You will also need to configure payment notifications for your server.  Within https://admin.conekta.io#developers.webhooks, create a new url which points to your server.
If your server has mod_rewrite enabled, the url for your webhook will be:
    `http://mydomain.com/invoice/ajax/listener`
Otherwise, your url for your webhook will be:
    `http://mydomain.com/index.php/invoice/ajax/listener`
After having completed these steps the payment methods should be enabled for testing.

Inventory Notes
---------------

Your product inventory will only be adjusted when your server receives a payment notification from Conekta, this allows for offline payment methods like Bank Deposits and Oxxo to be processed

Dependency Notes
-----------

Included modules for the plugin include:
  * Conekta_Bank
  * Conekta_Oxxo
  * Conekta_Card
  * Conekta_Invoice

The Conekta_Invoice must be enabled because it cointains basic logic shared with the rest of the modules that allow the plugin to work correctly.
It also handles inventory logic.  Without it, the inventory of each product purchased will be decremented even if the purchase was not successful.
